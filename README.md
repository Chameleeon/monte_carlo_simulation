# Monte Carlo Simulator

- Visually represents the process of estimating Pi with the Monte Carlo method.
- Written in python, so not as fast as it could be, I chose python because it was the simplest for implementing the visual representation

# How To Run

- <b>NOTE: Requires python3</b>

Clone the repository and run the script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chameleeon/monte_carlo_simulation.git
cd monte_carlo_simulation
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
